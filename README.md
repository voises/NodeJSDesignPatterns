# NodeJSDesignPatterns
Reading and working through Node.js Design Patterns 3e by Casciaro and Mammino.

I will be going through the book, providing short form notes where relevant, and using code to further explain the concepts.
My goal is to read a chapter a day, and therefore finish this it in no more than 2 weeks. 
Each chapter will be broken up by the respective folder.

Edit: It has taken longer than 2 weeks, but I will try to finish it as soon as possible.
