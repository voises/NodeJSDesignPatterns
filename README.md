# NodeJSDesignPatterns
Reading and working through Node.js Design Patterns 3e by Casciaro and Mammino.

I will be going through the book, providing short form notes where relevant, and using code to further explain the concepts.
My goal is to read a chapter a day, and therefore finish this it in no more than 2 weeks.
